  <h1>Travel Planning and Reservations</h1>
  <p>Here are country-specific guidelines for these office locations.</p>
  <p data-condition="Location:UK"><strong>For the United Kingdom:</strong> Fintech and payments are viewed as a high priority for increased investment by the travel industry. It&#39;s an effective way to improve the traveler experience and increase sales.  Technology is changing how money moves and investment is rapidly rising. The goal of &quot;frictionless travel&quot; is accomplished by making buyer payments easier.</p>
  <p data-condition="Location:US"><strong>For the United States: </strong>In a highly mobile, globally based customer base, standardizing financial transactions is complicated by the lack of a shared, global currency. Fintech can solve these problems.</p>
  <p data-condition="Location:Canada"><strong> For Canada:</strong> “Buy now, pay later” (BNPL) payment methods present a huge opportunity for the travel domain. Innovative financing arrangements let travelers choose from a wider range of hotel and transportation providers by delaying payment.  NOTE: &quot;Buy now, pay later&quot; payment methods may not be available in all countries.</p>
