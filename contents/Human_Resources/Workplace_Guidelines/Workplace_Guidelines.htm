  <h1>Workplace Guidelines</h1>
  <h2>Attendance</h2>
  <p>All employees are expected to arrive on time, ready to work, every day they are scheduled to work.<br />
    If unable to arrive at work on time, or if an employee will be absent for an entire day, the employee must contact the supervisor as soon as possible. Voicemail, text, and e-mail messages are not acceptable except in certain emergency circumstances. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in discipline up to and including termination. Failure to show up or call in for a scheduled shift without prior approval also may result in discipline up to and including termination. If an employee fails to report to work or call in to inform the supervisor of the absence for 3 consecutive days or more, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned employment.</p>
  <h2>Job Performance</h2>
  <p>Communication between employees and supervisors or managers is very important. Discussions regarding job performance are ongoing and often informal. Employees should initiate conversations with their supervisors if they feel additional ongoing feedback is needed.<br />
    Generally, formal performance reviews are conducted annually. These reviews include a written performance appraisal and discussion between the employee and the supervisor about job performance and expectations for the coming year.</p>
  <h2>Outside Employment</h2>
  <p>Employees generally are permitted to work a second job as long as it does not interfere with their job performance or create a conflict of interest with FintecNEWS. All employees, including part-time employees, must obtain prior approval from the HR department before undertaking any outside employment or other work activity.</p>
  <p>Employees with a second job are expected to work their assigned schedules. second job will not be considered an excuse for poor job performance, absenteeism, tardiness, leaving early, refusal to travel, or refusal to work overtime or different hours.  In addition, employees who have accepted outside employment may not use paid sick time to work on the outside job. However, an employee on a leave of absence may continue to work in the outside job if this employment has been approved by the company under this policy and the employee’s reason for leave does not preclude the outside employment.<br />
    If outside work activity causes or contributes to job-related problems, it must be discontinued, or the employee may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.</p>
  <h2><br />
    Cell Phone Safety and Driving</h2>
  <div data-conref="../../assets/snippets/State_Laws.hts"> </div>
  <p>Safe driving is the first priority when operating a vehicle while driving on FintecNEWS business. Your first responsibility is to pay attention to your driving. Never allow a cell phone or other mobile device to distract you from concentrating on driving.</p>
  <p>Under no circumstances should you feel that you need to place yourself or others at risk while driving to fulfill business needs. You should follow these procedures to avoid distracted driving:</p>
  <ul class="RoundSquare">
    <li>Follow all applicable state and local laws that address the use of cell phones and other mobile devices while driving.</li>
    <li>Avoid using your cell phone while driving, and do not use it as a hand-held device. Find a safe place to pull over to make or receive phone calls, send or receive text messages, or manipulate navigation apps.</li>
    <li>Program your destination into navigation apps or GPS devices before you start driving.</li>
    <li>Do not read or respond to text messages or e-mail or browse social media or the Internet while driving.</li>
    <li>Be aware of distractions from in-car “infotainment” systems. Just because they are built into the vehicle does not mean they do not create a hazardous distraction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Employees who fail to follow safety guidelines are subject to discipline.</p>
  <h2>Social Media Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>FintecNEWS encourages employees to share information with coworkers and with those outside the company for the purposes of gathering information, generating new ideas, and learning from the work of others. Social media provides inexpensive, informal, and timely ways to participate in an exchange of ideas and information. However, information posted on a website is available to the public, and therefore, the company has established the following guidelines for employee participation in social media.</p>
  <p class="emphasis1-left"><strong>Note:</strong> As used in this policy, “social media” refers to blogs, forums, and social networking sites, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat, among others.<br />
    Off-duty use of social media. Employees may maintain personal websites or weblogs on their own time using their own facilities. Employees must ensure that social media activity does not interfere with their work. In general, the company considers social media activities to be personal endeavors, and employees may use them to express their thoughts or promote their ideas.  In addition, employees may not post on a personal blog or webpage or participate on a social networking platform for personal purposes during work time or at any time with <span data-keyref="Company_Name">FintecNEWS</span> equipment or property.</p>
  <h3>On-duty use of social media</h3>
  <p>Employees may engage in social media activity during work time provided it is directly related to their work and approved by their manager and does not identify or reference company clients, customers, or vendors without express permission. The company monitors employee use of company computers and the Internet, including employee blogging and social networking activity.<br />
    Respect. Demonstrate respect for the dignity of the company, its owners, its customers, its vendors, and its employees. A social media site is a public place, and employees should avoid inappropriate comments. For example, employees should not divulge <span data-keyref="Company_Name">FintecNEWS</span> confidential information such as trade secrets, client lists, or information restricted from disclosure by law on social media sites.  Similarly, employees should not engage in harassing or discriminatory behavior that targets other employees or individuals because of their protected class status or make defamatory comments or engage in other behavior that violates the company’s policies.</p>
  <h3>Post disclaimers</h3>
  <p>Employees who identify themselves as company employees or discuss matters related to the company on a social media site must include a disclaimer on the front page stating that it does not express the views of the company and that the employees are expressing only personal views—for example: “The views expressed on this website/Weblog are mine alone and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.” Place the disclaimer in a prominent position, and repeat it for each posting expressing an opinion related to the company or the company’s business. Employees must keep in mind that if they post information on a social media site that is in violation of company policy and/or federal, state, or local law, the disclaimer will not shield them from disciplinary action.<br />
    Competition</p>
  <p>Employees should not use social media to criticize the company’s competition and should not use it to compete with the company.</p>
  <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
  <p>Do not identify or reference company clients, customers, or vendors without express permission. Employees may write about their jobs in general but may not disclose any confidential or proprietary information. For examples of confidential information, please refer to the confidentiality policy. When in doubt, ask before publishing.</p>
  <h2>New ideas</h2>
  <p>Please remember that new ideas related to work or the company’s business belong to the company. Do not post them on a social media site without the company’s permission</p>
  <h2>Solicitation</h2>
  <p>Employees should be able to work in an environment that is free from unnecessary annoyances and interference with their work. In order to protect our employees and visitors, solicitation by employees is strictly prohibited while either the employee being solicited or the employee doing the soliciting is on “working time.” “Working time” is defined as time during which an employee is not at a meal, on break, or on the premises immediately before or after a shift.<br />
    Employees are also prohibited from distributing written materials, handbills, or any other type of literature on working time and, at all times, in “working areas,” which include all office areas. “Working areas” do not include break rooms, parking lots, or common areas shared by employees during nonworking time.<br />
    Nonemployees may not trespass or solicit or distribute materials anywhere on company property at any time.<br />
    Nothing in this policy is meant to, nor should it be interpreted to, in any way limit your rights under any applicable federal, state, or local laws, including your rights under the NLRA to engage in protected concerted activities with other employees to improve or discuss terms and conditions of employment, such as wages, working conditions, and benefits. Employees have the right to engage in or refrain from such activities.</p>
  <h2>Computers, Internet, Email, and Other Resources</h2>
  <p>FintecNEWS provides a wide variety of communication tools and resources to employees for use in running day-to-day business activities. Whether it is the telephone, voicemail, scanner, Internet, intranet, e-mail, text messaging, portable electronic devices, or any other company-provided technology, use should be reserved for business-related matters during working hours. All communication using these tools should be handled in a professional and respectful manner.<br />
    Employees should not have any expectation of privacy in their use of company computer, phone, portable electronic devices, or other communication tools. All communications made using company-provided equipment or services, including e-mail and Internet activity, are subject to inspection by the company. Employees should keep in mind that even if they delete an e-mail, a voicemail, or another communication, a copy may be archived on the company’s systems.<br />
    Employee use of company-provided communication systems, including personal e-mail and Internet use, that is not job-related has the potential to drain, rather than enhance, productivity and system performance. You should also be aware that information transmitted through e-email and the Internet is not completely secure or may contain viruses or malware, and information you transmit and receive could damage the company’s systems, as well as the reputation and/or competitiveness of the company. To protect against possible problems, delete any e-mail messages before opening that are received from unknown senders and advertisers. It also is against company policy to turn off antivirus protection software or make unauthorized changes to system configurations installed on company computers. Violations of this policy may result in termination for a first offense.<br />
    The company encourages employees to use e-mail only to communicate with fellow employees, suppliers, customers, or potential customers regarding company business. Internal and external e-mails are considered business records and may be subject to federal and state recordkeeping requirements, as well as to discovery in the event of litigation. Be aware of this possibility when sending e-mails within and outside the company.<br />
    All use of company-provided communications systems, including e-mail and Internet use, should conform to our company guidelines/policies, including but not limited to the Equal Opportunity, Harassment, Confidential Information, and Conflicts of Interest. So, for example, employees should not engage in harassing or discriminatory behavior that targets other employees or individuals because of their protected class status or make defamatory comments. Similarly, employees should not divulge confidential information such as trade secrets, client lists, or information restricted from disclosure by law on social media sites.<br />
    Because e-mail, telephone and voicemail, and Internet communication equipment are provided for company business purposes and are critical to the company’s success, your communications may be accessed without further notice by IT department administrators and company management to ensure compliance with this guideline.</p>
  <h2>Disciplinary Procedure</h2>
  <p style="margin-right: 0.03in">FintecNEWS expects employees to comply with the company’s standards of behavior and performance and to correct any noncompliance with these standards.</p>
  <p>Under normal circumstances, FintecNEWS endorses a policy of progressive discipline in which it attempts to provide employees with notice of deficiencies and an opportunity to improve. It does, however, retain the right to administer discipline in any manner it sees fit. This policy does not modify the status of employees as employees at will or in any way restrict the company’s right to bypass the disciplinary procedures suggested.</p>
  <p>The following steps are suggested in the discipline procedure. All steps should be documented in the employee’s personnel file.</p>
  <ol class="step">
    <li>Informal Discussion. When a performance problem is first identified, the nature of the problem and the action necessary to correct it should be thoroughly discussed with the employee.</li>
    <li>Counseling. If a private informal discussion with the employee has not resulted in corrective action, following a thorough investigation, the supervisor should meet with the employee and (a) review the problem, (b) permit the employee to present information regarding the problem, (c) advise the employee that the problem must be corrected, (d) inform the employee that failure to correct the problem will result in further disciplinary action that may include discharge, and (e) issue a counseling notice to the employee.</li>
    <li>Reprimand. If satisfactory performance and corrective action are not achieved under Steps 1 and 2, the supervisor and a representative from the HR department should meet with the employee in private and proceed via (a) through (d) above and issue a reprimand notice to the employee.</li>
    <li>Suspension. Supervisors have the authority to temporarily remove employees from the workplace, with or without pay, if approved in advance by the department director and the director of HR. An exempt employee generally may not be suspended without pay for less than a full day, and the suspension must be related to written workplace conduct rules applicable to all employees, such as a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment or workplace violence.</li>
    <li>Failure to improve. Failure to improve performance or behavior after the written warning or suspension can result in termination.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The progressive disciplinary procedures described above also may be applied to an employee who is experiencing a series of unrelated problems involving job performance or behavior.</p>
  <p>In cases involving serious misconduct, or any time the supervisor determines it is necessary, such as a major breach of policy or violation of law, the procedures contained above may be disregarded. Typically, the supervisor should suspend the employee immediately (with or without pay), and an investigation of the incidents leading up to the suspension should be conducted to determine if any further action, such as termination, should be taken.</p>
