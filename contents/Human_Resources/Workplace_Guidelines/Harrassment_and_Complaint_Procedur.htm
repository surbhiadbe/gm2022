  <h1>Harassment and Complaint Procedure</h1>
  <p class="emphasis1">[NOTE: There may be state or local laws with different requirements that must be considered.]</p>
  <p>It is FintecNEWS’ policy to prohibit intentional and unintentional harassment of or against job applicants, contractors, interns, volunteers, or employees by another employee, supervisor, vendor, customer, or third party based on actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, and pregnancy-related conditions), gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, military service and veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws. Such conduct will not be tolerated by FintecNEWS.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, any retaliation against an individual who has complained about sexual or other harassment or retaliation against individuals for cooperating with an investigation of a harassment complaint is similarly unlawful and will not be tolerated. FintecNEWS will take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent and eliminate unlawful harassment.</p>
  <p>Unlawful harassment includes, but is not limited to, epithets; slurs; jokes; pranks; innuendo; comments; written or graphic material; stereotyping; or other threatening, hostile, or intimidating acts based on race, color, ancestry, national origin, gender, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, age, disability, veteran status, or another characteristic protected by state or federal law.</p>
  <p>Definition of “sexual harassment.” While all forms of harassment are prohibited, special attention should be paid to sexual harassment. “Sexual harassment” can include all of the above actions, as well as other unwelcome conduct, and is generally defined under both state and federal law as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature whereby:</p>
  <ol class="RoundSquare">
    <li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of any individual’s employment or as a basis for employment decisions.</li>
    <li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, a hostile, or an offensive work environment.</li>
    <li>Other sexually oriented conduct, whether intended or not, that is unwelcome and has the effect of creating a work environment that is hostile, offensive, intimidating, or humiliating to workers may also constitute sexual harassment.</li>
    <li>While it is not possible to list all those additional circumstances that may constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples of conduct that, if unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment depending on the totality of the circumstances, including the severity of the conduct and its pervasiveness:</li>
    <li>Unwanted sexual advances, whether they involve physical touching or not.</li>
  </ol>
