  <h1>Equal Opportunity and Diversity</h1>
  <p>In this detailed topic we cover very important policies observed by FintecNEWS employees.</p>
  <p><a class="dropspot-twisty" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down" href="#">Equal Opportunity</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down">
    <p>FintecNEWS provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, creed, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, and pregnancy-related conditions), gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, religion, age, disability,  genetic information,  service in the military, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state, or local laws and ordinances. Equal employment opportunity applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leave of absence, compensation, and training.</p>
    <p>FintecNEWS expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee harassment or discrimination based on any of the characteristics mentioned above. Improper interference with the ability of other employees to perform their expected job duties is absolutely not tolerated.</p>
    <p>FintecNEWS will endeavor to make a reasonable accommodation of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee related to an individual’s physical or mental disability, sincerely held religious beliefs and practices, and/or any other reason required by applicable law, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship upon FintecNEWS’ business operations.</p>
    <p>Any employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of the HR manager. The company will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who raise issues of equal employment opportunity. Employees who feel they have been subjected to any such retaliation should bring it to the attention of the HR manager.</p>
    <ol class="Decimal">
      <li>Retaliation means adverse conduct taken because an individual reported an actual or a perceived violation of this policy, opposed practices prohibited by this policy, or participated in the reporting and investigation process described below. “Adverse conduct” includes but is not limited to:</li>
      <li>Shunning and avoiding an individual who reports harassment, discrimination, or retaliation;</li>
      <li>Express or implied threats or intimidation intended to prevent an individual from reporting harassment, discrimination, or retaliation; or</li>
      <li>Denying employment benefits because an applicant or employee reported harassment, discrimination, or retaliation or participated in the reporting and investigation process.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Other examples of retaliation include firing, demotion, denial of promotion, unjustified negative evaluations, increased surveillance, harassment, and assault.</p>
    <p>Complaints of discrimination should be filed according to the procedures described in the Harassment and Complaint Procedure.</p>
  </div>
  <p><a class="dropspot-twisty" data-rhwidget="DropSpot" data-target="drop-down1" href="#">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Reasonable Accommodation</a></p>
  <div class="droptext" data-targetname="drop-down1">
    <p>FintecNEWS is committed to the fair and equal employment of individuals with disabilities under the ADA. It is FintecNEWS’s policy to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities unless the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the company. FintecNEWS prohibits any harassment of, or discriminatory treatment of, employees or applicants based on a disability or because an employee has requested a reasonable accommodation.</p>
    <p>In accordance with the ADA, reasonable accommodations will be provided to qualified individuals with disabilities to enable them to perform the essential functions of their jobs or to enjoy the equal benefits and privileges of employment. An employee or applicant with a disability may request an accommodation from the HR department and should specify what accommodation is needed to perform the job and submit supporting documentation explaining the basis for the requested accommodation, to the extent permitted and in accordance with applicable law. The company then will review and analyze the request, including engaging in an interactive process with the employee or applicant, to identify if such an accommodation can be made, or if any other possible accommodations are appropriate... If requested, the employee is responsible for providing medical documentation regarding the disability and possible accommodations. All information obtained concerning the medical condition or history of an applicant or employee will be treated as confidential information, maintained in separate medical files, and disclosed only as permitted by law.</p>
    <p>It is the policy of FintecNEWS to prohibit harassment or discrimination based on disability or because an employee has requested a reasonable accommodation. FintecNEWS prohibits retaliation against employees for exercising their rights under the ADA or other applicable civil rights laws. Employees should use the procedures described in the Harassment and Complaint Procedure to report any harassment, discrimination, or retaliation they have experienced or witnessed.<br /></p>
