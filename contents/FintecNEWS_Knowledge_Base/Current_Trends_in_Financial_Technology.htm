  <h1>Current Trends in Financial Technology</h1>
  <p style="font-weight: 500;font-size: 12pt">FinTech businesses use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) learn about customer behavior and improve their products. Here are areas where AI and ML are being applied:</p>
  <h2>Cybersecurity </h2>
  <p>Cyberhacking has increased rapidly. An important way to protect against this hazard is to use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques which assist security management by keeping up with the latest developments.</p>
  <h2>Analyze huge amounts of information</h2>
  <p>AI technologies create significant diagnostic capabilities to analyze large quantities of data and reveal important patterns.</p>
  <h2>Processing Sensitive Financial Data</h2>
  <p>Fraud is a perennial problem facing the finance industry. </p>
  <p>AI can find patterns and tell-tale behaviors which can be used to spot fraudulent activities and transactions. This can greatly lower the risk and improve the bottom line. </p>
  <h2>FinTech using Chatbots</h2>
  <p>Chatbots powered by AI minimize call center workload and free staff to assist more difficult issues, more quickly.<br/>
    Chatbots can also improve sales and cross-sell opportunities even as the customer gets their questions answered. </p>
  <h2>Banking Apps with Artificial Intelligence</h2>
  <p>Banking apps offer personalized financial advice to help users achieve their financial goals, track their income and expenses.<br/>
    This personalization categorizes customers based on their risk score.</p>
  <p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), is used by developers to train technologies on the user’s historical data and then classify their profile from low to high risk level.</p>
  <h2>Regtech</h2>
  <p>RegTech (Regulatory Technology) provides a way to manage regulatory compliance by applying AI algorithms. These handle client identification, transaction monitoring, regulatory analysis and reporting.</p>
  <h2>Teller Capture vs. Branch Capture</h2>
  <p>It used to take days to clear checks as the paper traveled from the bank of first deposit (BOFD) to the paying bank.  Now the clearing process has become much quicker.  Customers often see same day credit for deposited checks rather than the old three day float.</p>
  <p>In branch capture, scanned images are processed and proofed and corrections are made.  </p>
  <p>The branch capture process still involves hand work for the bank. </p>
  <p>Teller capture has become more popular with banks and other financial institutions.  The reasons for this include the availability of the software and network infrastructure to support the capture and passing of the volume of data required for teller image capture. The advantages of front-counter teller check capture include the reduction in FTEs, courier costs, costly counter documents, teller keystrokes, and fraud. </p>
