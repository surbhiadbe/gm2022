  <h1>How to use this Knowledge Base</h1>
  <h2>Table of Contents</h2>
  <p>Table of Contents shows the hierarchy of the content. This TOC can dynamically change if the user applies filters. </p>
  <h2>Search and Search Answer Boxes</h2>
  <p>A powerful search engine will bring up Search Answer Boxes which highlight the most likely answers and bring them up to the top of the search results list. </p>
  <h2>Dynamic Content Filtering</h2>
  <p>There are many reasons why you might want your users to see only certain parts of the content:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>In this sample website, you can test this Filter by clicking on the Filter icon <img src="../assets/images/Filter-icon.png"/> and select a &quot;<strong>Role</strong>&quot; from the Group. (<strong>Human Resources, <strong>Marketing</strong></strong> or <strong>Software</strong>). Notice the TOC changes for those three listings depending on what you select. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>There could be content for entry level or advanced users and you want the user to select what they need.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The content could cover a wide range of products and you want the user to be able to select one or more subsets.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Cross References and Hyperlinks</h2>
  <p>Hyperlinks from topic to topic or to bookmarks have been part of   from the first versions. Cross References can be thought of as links on steroids.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using hyperlinks, the text of the link never changes. If, for example, you change the name of the target topic, the link remains unchanged.</li>
    <li>Not so with cross-references, they update automatically. If you create a cross reference to a heading, for example, and then the heading changes, so does the link to it. For example, here is a hyperlink to the <a href="../FintecNEWS_Marketing/Online_Banking.htm">Online Banking</a> topic. </li>
    <li>Here is a cross reference link to <a data-xref="{title}" href="../FintecNEWS_Marketing/Online_Banking.htm">Online Banking</a> which would be perfect if I planned to change the Title in the future.  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Favorites</h2>
  <p>Users can now save Favorites. When a topic is opened they can add the topic as a &quot;Bookmark&quot; Favorite  by clicking the <img src="../assets/images/Favorite-icon.png"/> icon . The other icon allows the user to see all their favorites and select from the list. </p>
  <h2>Adobe Captivate Videos and eLearning</h2>
  <p>Multimedia eLearning is provided by including Adobe Captivate video demonstrations as well as quizzes.</p>
